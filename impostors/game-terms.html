<p>Last Updated: August 11, 2022</p>
<p>Welcome to the Impostors Game Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). This is a legal agreement between you and Super Studios, Inc. (&quot;Super Studios&quot;) regarding our Services. &quot;Services&quot; means collectively, and sometimes individually, (a) the Game and (b) any services we provide relating to our Game, whether or not the Game is installed or used on a computer, console, or a mobile device. &quot;Game&quot; means our Impostors game that you download and access that is subject to these Terms, regardless of where you download and/or access it, and any documentation, software, updates, Virtual Goods and Content (each defined below) included in the game.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION FOR U.S. USERS: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND US THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 18 &quot;DISPUTE RESOLUTION AND GOVERNING LAW â€“ UNITED STATES&quot; BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. THESE TERMS ALSO INCLUDE A WAIVER OF RIGHTS BY YOU TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US AND A LIMITATION ON DAMAGES THAT YOU CAN COLLECT FROM US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. BY USING THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THESE PROVISIONS.</p>
<p>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT INSTALL, OR USE OUR SERVICES. WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION (SEE SECTION 8), ANYTHING YOU PURCHASE FROM US IS NON-REFUNDABLE.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>Defined Terms</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You&#x27;ll notice some capitalized terms in these Terms. They&#x27;re called &quot;defined terms,&quot; and we use them so we don&#x27;t have to repeat the same language again and again, and to make sure that the use of these terms is consistent throughout the Terms. We&#x27;ve included the defined terms throughout because we want it to be easy for you to read them in context.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2>Additional Terms</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some Services may be available through accessing (or downloading from) (a) Impostors Launcher, Xsolla or a third-party platform, or (b) the website and interface located at <a href="index.html">https://impostors.gg/</a> (&quot;Website&quot;), which will link to a third-party platform or store, including but not limited to, the Epic Games platform, the Google Play Store and Apple App Store (Xsolla, third-party platforms or stores, each, an &quot;App Store&quot;), and such access will allow you to download the Game. Your use of the Services is also governed by any applicable agreements you have with any App Store (the &quot;App Store Agreement(s)&quot;) and/or the separate Terms of Service located at <a href="terms.html">https://impostors.gg/terms</a> (the &quot;Website Terms&quot;). In the event of a conflict between any other App Store Agreement(s) or Website Terms from which you acquire or access our Game and these Terms with respect to your use of the Services, these Terms will take priority.</p>
<p>Users may use certain digital assets available through third parties in the form of non-fungible cryptocurrency tokens (&quot;NFTs&quot;) (such NFTs, the &quot;Impostors NFTs&quot;) in the Game, including but not limited to the Genesis Aliens. If you use the Impostors NFTs in the Game, you agree to be bound by and comply with the Website Terms. Further, you agree and acknowledge that all rights and obligations associated with the Impostors NFTs are governed by the NFT Purchase and License Agreement (&quot;NFT Terms&quot;), which may be promulgated by a third party.</p>
<p>The collection of information from you and related to the Services (whether obtained through an App Store or Website or not) is governed by our Privacy Policy at <a href="privacy.html">https://impostors.gg/privacy</a>. Our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information that we collect from and about you.</p>

If you are under 18 years of age, you must have one of your parents (or legal guardians) read these Terms and accept them on your behalf. Parents and guardians are responsible for the acts of their minor children when using any of our Services, and if you are a parent or guardian accepting these Terms, you understand and agree that you will be responsible for all uses of our Services by your minor child whether or not you authorized such uses. You may not create or use a Game Account, or use or access any of our Services on behalf of a legal entity or for a commercial purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>

To access parts of the Game, you may need to connect your account you may have with any App Store (your &quot;App Store Account&quot;) to the Services or create an account with a third-party platform that we direct you to and provide certain information, such as your email, username, password, and ETH address (your &quot;Game Account&quot;). To the extent you create your Game Account through the use of a third-party account, we may access certain personal information that the third party provides to us such as your email address and name to help create your Game Account. Further information about use of third-party accounts is provided in the Privacy Policy at <a href="privacy.html">https://impostors.gg/privacy</a>.</p>

It&#x27;s important that you provide us with accurate, complete and up-to-date information for your Game Account and you agree to update such information to keep it that way. If you don&#x27;t, we may suspend or terminate your Game Account. You agree that you will not disclose your Game Account password to anyone and will notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your Game Account. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Game Account, whether or not you know about them. If you believe that your Game Account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us at <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#0c7f797c7c637e784c7f797c697e7f78796865637f226563"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="186b6d6868776a6c586b6d687d6a6b6c6d7c71776b367177">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<h2>Ownership of the Services</h2>
<p>We and our affiliates and licensors own all title, ownership and intellectual property rights in the Services. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Services. You understand and agree that you have no ownership interest in the Services or Game or Content therein. The Services (and particularly our Game) may have built-in mechanisms designed to prevent granting one user an unfair advantage over other users (these actions are &quot;Cheating&quot;, and the software is the &quot;Cheat Detection Software&quot;). We may add or update our Cheat Detection Software periodically as we may require in our sole discretion. The Services and/or the Cheat Detection Software may collect and transmit details about your Game Account, gameplay, and unauthorized programs or processes in connection with Cheating, subject to our Privacy Policy and applicable law. In the event that we in our sole discretion conclude that you are Cheating, you agree that we may exercise any or all of our rights under these Terms, including termination of these Terms and your access to our Services.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable privacy laws, although we are not obligated to monitor access to or use of the Services or to review or edit any Content, we have the right to do so for the purpose of operating and publishing the Services, to ensure compliance with these Terms, to protect the health or safety of anyone that we believe may be threatened, to protect our legal rights and remedies, to report a crime or offensive behavior, or to comply with applicable law. We may (but don&#x27;t have to) remove or disable access to any Content, at any time and without notice. We may (but don&#x27;t have to) investigate violations of these Terms or conduct that affects the Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Virtual Goods, Game Currency, and Subscriptions</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Purchasing or Obtaining Virtual Goods and Game Currency. You may purchase with real world currency on third-party platforms, or earn by playing the Game, the in-game currency, BLOOD (&quot;Game Currency&quot;). For the avoidance of doubt, Game Currency does not include SUPER. We may also offer certain upgrades and options within our Game that you can buy with real world currency or the Game Currency, including, but not limited to, Genesis Land, UFOs, Pets, Cosmetics Boxes, Materials Boxes, Closed Beta Passes, and other Genesis Season Assets in the Game metaverse, and other such digital add-on items that may improve your Game experience in some way (&quot;Virtual Goods&quot;). If you purchase Game Currency, Virtual Goods, or a Subscription (defined below) (each, a &quot;Transaction&quot;), your purchase will be made through the functionality available through the App Store, Website or other platforms we make available to you. Prior to making a Transaction, you should make sure you fully understand the agreement that covers your Transaction, whether that agreement is an App Store Agreement, Website Terms or another third-party platform agreement (like a third-party payment processor&#x27;s terms). There may be limits to the quantity and number of times you can purchase Virtual Goods or other aspects of your Transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your Use of Virtual Goods and Game Currency. Virtual Goods and Game Currency are digital items and your use of them is governed by these Terms, the App Store Agreement(s), the Website Terms, the NFT Terms, or other third-party platform agreements, as applicable.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Game Currency and Virtual Goods that are Transferable. While the Game Currency and some of the Virtual Goods may be transferable outside of the Game, as communicated or shown to you within the functionality of the Game, we are not responsible for any use or transfer of the Game Currency and Virtual Goods outside of the functionality of the Game. You may be entitled to use the Game Currency and Virtual Goods with compatible third-party applications, but we expressly disclaim and do not make any warranty that the Game Currency and Virtual Goods will be compatible with such third-party applications. You further agree that you will not use or transfer the Game Currency and applicable Virtual Goods for inappropriate, harmful, or illegal purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Virtual Goods that are Not Transferable. SOME VIRTUAL GOODS, AS COMMUNICATED OR SHOWN TO YOU WITHIN THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE GAME, HAVE NO MONETARY VALUE AND CANNOT BE REDEEMED FOR CASH. SOME VIRTUAL GOODS ARE NON-TRANSFERABLE AND NON-TRADABLE, IN WHOLE OR PART, AND ARE NOT PROVIDED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. For such Virtual Goods, provided you comply with the terms of these Terms and the App Store Agreement(s) and Website Terms, we grant you the following license: a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited right and license to use any Virtual Goods you gain access to, whether purchased or otherwise obtained, solely in connection with your use of the Game and within the Game and for no other purpose. Unless expressly permitted by us, you may not trade any such Virtual Good with others. We may cancel, revoke, or otherwise prevent the use of Virtual Good if we suspect any unauthorized or fraudulent activity, and/or to correct any erroneous application of any Virtual Goods to your Game Account.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changes to Game Currency and Virtual Goods. Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law, we, in our sole discretion, may modify, substitute, replace, suspend, cancel or eliminate any Game Currency or Virtual Goods, including your ability to access or use Game Currency or Virtual Goods, without notice or liability to you. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WON&#x27;T ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM AGAINST US, OUR AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR LICENSORS (THE &quot;SUPER STUDIOS PARTIES&quot;) RELATING TO (A) A CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE A PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN ANY GAME CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL GOODS; OR (B) A CLAIM FOR AN ALLEGED MONETARY VALUE OF GAME CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL GOODS LOST UPON (I) DELETION OR SUSPENSION OF YOUR ACCOUNT, (II) ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GAME THAT RESULT IN THE VALUE OF VIRTUAL GOODS OR GAME CURRENCY CHANGING, OR (III) MODIFICATION, TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF THESE TERMS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subscriptions. Although certain features of the Game or the Services may be available at no charge, other features and/or Content may only be available via a subscription plan (&quot;Subscription&quot;). Subscriptions, if offered, give full access to all the Subscription features as long as Subscription is active. If you purchase a Subscription, you must ensure all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including, without limitation, your credit/debit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental or guardian consent if you are under 18 years of age. You agree to pay all Subscription fees specified when you purchase a Subscription including all applicable taxes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>Subject to applicable law, (i) the Game and certain Virtual Goods, as communicated or shown to you within the functionality of the Game and except for those that are transferable outside of the Game, remain our property, have no monetary value and are not redeemable, refundable, or eligible for any other alternate remedy for any &quot;real world&quot; money or anything of monetary value, unless they are defective, unavailable, or do not perform in accordance with the specifications we provide; (ii) we may revoke your license to such Game or Virtual Goods at any time consistent with these Terms without notice or liability to you; and (iii) by purchasing and/or using any Game, Virtual Goods and/or Game Currency, if applicable, you hereby waive any statutory right you may have to withdraw from your agreement to purchase the applicable Game, Virtual and/or Game Currency and you agree that you will therefore not be eligible to receive a refund (or any alternative remedy) in relation to such Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency. Where applicable law does not permit you to waive your right to so withdraw, you hereby agree that such withdrawal right expires immediately upon purchase and/or delivery of your Game, Virtual Good and/or Game Currency, as permitted by applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Accessing the Game from an App Store</h2>
<p>Where the Game is made available to you via an App Store (like the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), whether or not on your mobile device, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>These Terms are between you and us, not the App Store, and we (not the App Store), are solely responsible for the Game.</li>
<li>The App Store has no obligation to provide any Game maintenance or support.</li>
<li>If the Game cannot meet its warranties (if any), you can contact the App Store and they will refund you the purchase price of the Game (if applicable) and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the App Store will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Game.

<ol>
<li>LOSS OF PROFITS,</li>
<li>LOST REVENUE,</li>
<li>LOST SAVINGS,</li>

</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<h2>Dispute Resolution and Governing Law â€“ United States</h2>
<p>This section applies if you are accessing, using, or have purchased the Services in the United States.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Governing Law. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 18(b)-(i) below, the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Super Studios are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, and you and Super Studios each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services (collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;) will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and Super Studios agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Super Studios are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 18(b) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p>Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won&#x27;t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we&#x27;ll pay all of our attorneys&#x27; fees and costs and won&#x27;t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#x27; fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section 18(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#x27;s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class Action Waiver. YOU AND SUPER STUDIOS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties&#x27; dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person&#x27;s claims with your claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effect of Changes on Arbitration. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13 &quot;Service and Terms Modifications&quot; above, if Super Studios changes any of the terms of this Section 18 &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; after the date you most recently accepted these Terms, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html#aedddbdedec1dcdaeedddbdecbdcdddadbcac7c1dd80c7c1"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2754525757485553675452574255545352434e4854094e48">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date above or in the date of Super Studios&#x27; email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Super Studios in accordance with the terms of this Section 18 &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; as of the date you most recently accepted these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 18(f) of these Terms (&quot;Class Action Waiver&quot;), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Dispute Resolution and Governing Law â€“ Outside the United States</h2>
<p>This section applies if you are accessing, using, or have purchased the Services outside of the United States. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes will be the state and federal courts located in Los Angeles, California, and you and Super Studios each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>No Assignment</h2>
<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and void. Notwithstanding the title of this Section, we may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Entire Agreement. These Terms and any other document or information referred to in these Terms constitutes the entire and exclusive understanding between you and us regarding the Services and supersede any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between you and us regarding the Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Language. The original language of these Terms is in English; any translations are provided for reference purposes only. You waive any right you may have under the law of your country to have these Terms written or construed in any other language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Severability. These Terms describe certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your jurisdiction. These Terms do not change your rights under the laws of your jurisdiction if the laws of your jurisdiction do not permit it to do so. As noted above, limitations and exclusions of warranties and remedies in these Terms may not apply to you because your jurisdiction may not allow them in your particular circumstance. In the event that certain provisions of these Terms are held by a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, those provisions will be enforced only to the furthest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining terms of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Waiver. Your and our actions or inactions will not create any other rights under these Terms except as what is explicitly written within these Terms. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by one of our duly authorized representatives. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Third-Party Rights. Except as described in Section 9, a person who is not a party to these Terms will have no right under to enforce any of its terms.</p>
